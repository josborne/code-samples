============

Random code samples I've written over the last few years.

*From Wecombinate.com*:
- dashboard_page.js & dashboard_page.php
- products.php
- promote_model.php

A Codeigniter project using Knockout.js for the interactive UI.  The dashboard page shows the markup with the Knockout.js view model.  products.php is a Codeigniter controller that manages product listings and pagination as well as CRUD operations on products.  The promote_model.php is a Codeigniter model for interacting with the database tables related to product promotions.


*From WP-Pay-What-You-Like*:
- pwyl.js

WP-Pay-What-You-Like is a WordPress plugin for digital product sales.  pwyl.js is the javascript code that handles the payment form validation and interaction with the Stripe Checkout payment gateway API.

*Other files*:
- ShopifyScraper.py

A quick python script I wrote to scrape the Shopify app store and store all data and images for each product in a CSV file.

I'll add more samples over time and on request if there is something in particular people would like to see.
